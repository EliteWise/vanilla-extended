# vanilla-extended

The VanillaEnhancer plugin introduces simple features to enhance the gameplay for players who wish to stay true to the vanilla Minecraft experience.

## Features:

- Teleport Request (/tpa):
  Players can send a teleportation request to another player using /tpa <PlayerName>.
  The targeted player can then accept the request using the /tpok command.

- Spawn Command (/spawn):
  Quickly teleport back to the world's spawn point using the /spawn command.
  
- Biome Display in Tablist:
  Players can now see the biome they're currently in directly in the tablist. This saves time and provides quick information without the need to check manually.
